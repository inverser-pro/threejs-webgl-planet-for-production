# ThreeJS WEBGL 3D planet for production

## Planet / globe / earth on threejs (webgl) with API interaction.

At the moment, the API is implemented only statically.

My goal is to create a complete version, without the API to begin with. then add the API.

## What do I mean by API?

API in the classical sense is the transfer of some data that comes from the server.

First, I will make it possible to add various functions without an API, that is, I will create the first version of the planet so that you can pass the necessary static data.

In the final version, I would like the data to create "boom" and lines, with highlighted text and guides, to be transferred using the server or something else.

Those. the ultimate goal is an analogue of the planet with GITHUB / home

This code uses the THREEJS library.
